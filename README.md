### Features Left to Implement



## Testing 
HTML Validator

### Validator Testing 
- I encountered an error relating me to using the same ID mulitple times, this was an easy fix as i changed the ID's to Classes and it kept the context of the page looking the way i wanted it to. 
- Another error found was because i had used LI elements below a section element, this was also an easy fix as i changed the section to a DIV 


### Unfixed Bugs
