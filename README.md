# South East Asia


## Introduction
South East Asia is a website to give fellow travellers a basic guide to travelling around Thailand and Vietnam. The website shows users the best places to go, things to do, and places to stay in both Thailand and Vietnam. The website offers a competition that the users can enter to win the chance of a free boat trip around Halong Bay, provided they get all three questions correct.

- I wanted to make the site as simple to use as possible, the navbar and hyperlinks make the site very user friendly and easy to navigate

## Testing

### Validator Testing
- I encountered an error relating me to using the same ID multiple times, this was an easy fix as i changed the ID's to Classes and it kept the context of the page looking the way i wanted it to.
- Another error found was because i had used LI elements below a section element, this was also an easy fix as i changed the section to a DIV
- During the testing process i made sure the site was responsive on three screen sizes ( Phone Ipad Desktop)
